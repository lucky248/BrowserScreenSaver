# Browser Screen Saver

This is a very simple WPF-based screen saver that embeds 4 resizable browser windows. In the configuration of the screen saver you can specify the URIs for these browser windows. By default, interaction with browser is limited (navigation is disabled), but you can temporarily disable that via settings dialog.

Here is an [example](https://github.com/lucky248/BrowserScreenSaver/blob/master/Example.png?raw=true) of how it looks.
